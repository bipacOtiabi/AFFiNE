RunDLL errors are annoying pop-up messages that appear when you start your computer or launch a program. They usually indicate that there is a problem with a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) file, which is a module that contains code and data for various functions of Windows and third-party applications[^4^].

Some common causes of RunDLL errors are:
 
- Corrupted or missing DLL files due to malware infection, improper installation or uninstallation, or accidental deletion.
- Invalid or outdated registry entries that point to non-existent or wrong DLL files.
- Conflicts between different versions of DLL files used by different programs.

To fix RunDLL errors, you need to identify the source of the problem and apply the appropriate solution. Here are some methods you can try:
 
## Method 1: Scan Your System for Malware
 
Malware can damage or replace DLL files, causing RunDLL errors. To check if your system is infected, you need to run a full scan with a reliable antivirus program. You can use Windows Defender or any other antivirus software you prefer. Follow the steps below to scan your system with Windows Defender:

1. Open the Start menu and type "Windows Security". Click on the app icon to open it.
2. Select "Virus & threat protection" from the left pane.
3. Click on "Scan options" under the "Current threats" section.
4. Select "Full scan" and click on "Scan now".
5. Wait for the scan to complete and follow the instructions to remove any detected threats.

## Method 2: Update Your Drivers
 
Outdated or incompatible drivers can also cause RunDLL errors, especially if they are related to hardware devices. To update your drivers, you can use Device Manager or a third-party driver updater tool. Follow the steps below to update your drivers with Device Manager:

To repair corrupted system files, you can use the System File Checker (SFC) tool, which is a built-in utility that scans and restores missing or damaged system files. Follow the steps below to run SFC:

1. Open the Start menu and type "Command Prompt". Right-click on the app icon and select "Run as administrator".
2. Type "sfc /scannow" and press Enter. Wait for the scan to complete and fix any issues found.
3. Restart your computer and check if the RunDLL errors are gone.
